1. `import heapq`: Imports the heapq module, which provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm.
   
2. `import itertools`: Imports the itertools module, which provides various functions that operate on iterators to produce complex iterators.

3. `goal_state = (1, 2, 3, 8, 0, 4, 7, 6, 5)`: Defines the goal state of the 8-puzzle. Each number represents a tile, and 0 represents the blank tile.

4. `moves = {...}`: Defines a dictionary `moves` where keys are the index of the blank tile in the puzzle and values are the indices of the tiles that can be moved into the blank space.

5. `def heuristic(state):`: Defines a function named `heuristic` that calculates the Manhattan distance between the current state of the puzzle and the goal state.

6. `open_list = []`, `g_values = {}`, `came_from = {}`: Initializes lists and dictionaries to keep track of states, their respective g-values, and their parent states.

7. `while open_list:`: Starts a while loop that continues until `open_list` is empty.

8. `_, _, current = heapq.heappop(open_list)`: Pops the element with the lowest f-value from the `open_list` priority queue and assigns it to `current`.

9. `if current == goal_state:`: Checks if the current state is equal to the goal state.

10. `path = []`, `while current in came_from:`, `path.append(current)`, `current = came_from[current]`: If the goal state is not reached, backtracks through the parent states to reconstruct the path from the initial state to the goal state.

11. `return path[::-1]`: Returns the path from the initial state to the goal state.

12. `zero_index = current.index(0)`: Finds the index of the blank tile (0) in the current state of the puzzle.

13. `for move in moves[zero_index]:`: Iterates over the possible moves for the blank tile based on its index.

14. `new_state = list(current)`, `new_state[zero_index], new_state[move] = new_state[move], new_state[zero_index]`, `new_state = tuple(new_state)`: Creates a new state of the puzzle by swapping the blank tile with one of its neighboring tiles.

15. `tentative_g = g_values[current] + 1`: Calculates the tentative g-value for the new state.

16. `if new_state not in g_values or tentative_g < g_values[new_state]:`: Checks if the new state is not already explored or if the tentative g-value is less than the previously calculated g-value for the new state.

17. `g_values[new_state] = tentative_g`, `f_value = tentative_g + heuristic(new_state)`, `heapq.heappush(open_list, (f_value, next(itertools.count()), new_state))`: Updates the g-value for the new state, calculates the f-value, and pushes the new state into the priority queue with its f-value and an iterator from `itertools.count()` to ensure a strict ordering.

18. `start_state = (1, 2, 3, 8, 0, 4, 6, 5, 7)`: Defines the initial state of the puzzle.

19. `solution_path = astar(start_state)`: Calls the `astar` function with the initial state of the puzzle to find the solution path.

20. `if solution_path:`: Checks if a solution path exists.

21. `print("Solution found!")`, `print("Number of steps:", len(solution_path))`: Prints a message indicating that a solution is found and the number of steps in the solution path.

22. `for step, state in enumerate(solution_path):`: Iterates over each step in the solution path.

23. `print(f"Step {step + 1}:")`, `print(state[:3])`, `print(state[3:6])`, `print(state[6:])`: Prints each step of the solution path, representing the state of the puzzle in a 3x3 grid.

24. `else:`, `print("No solution found!")`: Prints a message indicating that no solution is found if the solution path is empty.
